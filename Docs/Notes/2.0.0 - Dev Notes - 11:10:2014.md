###Exchange Animation vs UITableViewRowAnimationFade

The problem is as follows:


- We call `renderRearrangeOnPoint:(CGPoint) at fromCoordinator:(I3GestureCoordinator *)coordinator` from the gesture coodinator
- We then call `rearrangeItemAtPoint:(CGPoint) from withItemAtPoint:(CGPoint) to inCollection:(id<I3Collection>) collection` on a collection's data source from the gesture coordinator, directly after
- The render delegate renders the exchange and dragging items using the `I3CloneView`, which just renders the source view's layer into its context
- The data delegate actually triggers an animation if we exchange the rows with `UITableViewRowAnimationFade`
- This intereferes with the concurrent drawing of the `I3CloneView` and we get a black clone view

Need to think of a way to work around this - perhaps the clone view pre-renders the source view on `initâ€¦` into a buffer that it can use later...?
