#2.0.0 - Dev Notes - 09/11/2014

###Data Source Design is Wrong

- The problem with the current design, which assumes that collections each have their own dragDataSource is as follows

	- Start dragging an item in Collection A

	- Stop drag on Collection B

	- The coordinator needs to call the drag data source to check whether this is allowed and update the data in _both_ data sources

	- Do we use the drag data source for Collection A or B? Do we use both?

- Clearly a flawed design

- We have 2 options, each comes with their own caveat:

	- Option 1: a single drag data source for all collections

		- Use the current `I3DragDataSource`
		- Have only 1 drag data source per coordinator
		- Allows us deal with all the data-logic in one delegate, e.g. we could have a `UIViewController` that deals with _all_ drag data management
		- Means that we would have to put all the logic for all collections in a single place, we wouldn't be able to split the logic into different data sources for each collection. This is similar to how version 1 deals with it
		- Perferred. Its simpler and I would argue that the majority of use cases would require all the data to be dealt with in 1 delegate (a view controller)

	- Option 2: individual drag data sources for each collection

		- Instead of passing the `inCollection` parameter to drag data sources, the data source would contain the collection as a property
		- The data source would perform operations on the collection as part of its state
		- The caveat is that we would not be able to deal with all the data in one place
		- In the use case in Option 1, for example, we'd have to create separate classes for each of the collections' data source, inject the collections into them along with the actual data structure that we're working from

- I like Option 1 more. Its simpler.
