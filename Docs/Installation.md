#Installation###RecommendedThe recommended way to install BetweenKit is via the popular dependency management tool, [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/):- __Install CocoaPods and setup a CocoaPods workspace__: if you don't have CocoaPods installed or are unfamiliar with its use, here are a couple of external resources that will help:	- [Getting started with CocoaPods](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html)	- [CocoaPods tutorial](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/streamlining-cocoa-development-with-cocoapods--mobile-15938)- __Add the BetweenKit pod to your project__: 		- Add `pod "BetweenKit", "~> 2.0.0"` to the targets in your Podfile.	- Update or install your pods via the command line with `pod update` or `pod install`.###Ad-hocAlternatively, if for whatever reason you aren't using CocoaPods, you can:- __Install it as a [Git submodule](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)__:		cd <Path to your application>		git init # If you haven't already initialized the directory as a repo		git submodule add https://github.com/ice3-software/between-kit.git		git submodule update --init --recursive				# Checkout version of your choice				cd between-kit		git checkout 2.0.0				# Git status your submodules and decide how to commit				cd ../ && git submodule status		...		- __Copy everything in the `Pod/` directory to your application__ (preferably in some sort of `Vendor` folder).Note that the preferred method of installation is via CocoaPods.#Dependencies and RequirementsBetweenKit is written in Objective-C with ARC enabled - Swift is not yet supported but [will be in the future](). Its main dependency is [UIKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIKit_Framework/).BetweenKit _should_ be compatible with iOS 6 upwards, however development is currently done in an XCode 6 environment and tests are run on iOS 8.* simulators alongside a couple of iOS 8.0/7.1 devices. ____<u>Documentation</u>: BetweenKit 2.0.0
