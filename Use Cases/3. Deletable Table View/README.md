#Use Case 3: _Deletable Table View_

- Demonstrates 1 `UITableView`
- Uses `UILongPressGestureRecongizer` to detect and coordinate drags
- Cells in this table view can be deleted by dropping them onto the delete area
- Deletion area highlights when dragging
	- Note that a cleaner way of achieving this would be to use a custom render delegate
	- See `16. Custom Render Delegate` for a better example
