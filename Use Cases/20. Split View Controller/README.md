#Use Case 20: _Split View Controller_

- Demonstrates recognizing drag / drops between split view controllers.
- `MasterViewController` sets up the dragging environment when its visible.
- The `I3GestureCoordinator` listens to gestures on the application's main window so that we can manage them over the bounds of 2 separate view controllers.
