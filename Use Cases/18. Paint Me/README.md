#Use Case 19: _Paint Me_

- Migrated from v1 - demonstrates a 'paintable' table view.
- The user can drag colours from the pallet at the bottom of the screen (first collection) onto the individual items in the notes table (second collection) to 'paint' them.
- The notes in the table view are also rearrangeable.
- Uses the default `UIPanGestureRecongizer` to detect drag / drops.
