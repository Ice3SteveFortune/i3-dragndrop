#BetweenKit [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ice3-software/between-kit.svg?branch=task-28-build-2.0.0)](https://travis-ci.org/ice3-software/between-kit) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/ice3-software/between-kit/badge.png?branch=task-52-static-analysis-mess-detection)](https://coveralls.io/r/ice3-software/between-kit?branch=task-52-static-analysis-mess-detection)

###Overview

BetweenKit is a robust framework, built on `UIKit` that allows you to build 'drag and drop' functionallity into your iOS application user interfaces. 

BetweenKit is based on the concepts of the original [i3-dragndrop]() helper, re-engineered from the ground up. 

###Features

- __Easy to integrate__: BetweenKit aims to work smoothly alongside Apple's built in UI components.

- __Rich 'drag and drop' abstraction__: abstracts away the gory details of gesture handling to provide a series of high-level 'drop/drop'-like events: drag starting, rearranging, deleting, dropping, etc.

- __Fully extensible__: customize everything from the drag/drop properties of individual items in a collection, to how the various drag/drop events are rendered on-screen. SOLID design of its core components gives you the flexibillity to [inject](), [extend](), [override](), [conform]() and [take control](http://i3.ytimg.com/vi/j4cokDb68jc/hqdefault.jpg).

- __Fully tested__: ~100% unit test coverage, 20 functional use case applications, used in production applications on the App Store [__NOTE__ where?]. It also comes bundled with a few test utilities to make it easier for contributors to write clean unit tests.

- __Fully documented__: full written documentation, extensive formatted comments and example code provided in the 20 use cases [__NOTE__ to come].

- __Reliable__: tried, tested, refined, re-tried and re-tested once more.

_Footnote_ .. that should take care of the shameless plug.
