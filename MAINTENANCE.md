Maintenance
===========

This document describes when the main contributors for IceCube Software (currently only me, Steve), have scheduled in maintenance time for this open source project.

This is so that users of this helper class are fully informed as to when they can expect to see progress and also so that contributors with pending PRs are informed as to when they can expect to see their PR reviewed/merged.


Schedule
--------

- Saturday 6th of April: 
	- Review Craig's PR
	- Investigate/fix oustanding bugs
	- Start on additional features
